# Formal Languages & Automata – Academic Project

Formal Languages &amp; Automata Project (Python, Lex/Yacc, DFA/NFA, Minimization)

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Theory of Languages / Compilation** course.
It focuses on the implementation of **finite automata** and **regular expressions**, combining
theoretical concepts with practical tools.

The project includes:
- Construction of automata from regular expressions
- Handling of ε-transitions
- Determinization, completion, and minimization of automata
- Equivalence checking between automata
- Use of **Lex & Yacc** for lexical and syntactic analysis
- A complete compilation workflow via a Makefile

## Technologies & Tools
- **Python** (automata manipulation and algorithms)
- **Lex / Yacc**
- **Makefile**
- Formal language theory (DFA, NFA, ε-NFA)

## Key Features
- Automata operations: union, concatenation, Kleene star
- ε-closure computation
- ε-transition elimination
- Determinization (subset construction)
- Completion with sink state
- Minimization (Moore algorithm)
- Language equivalence checking

## Academic Context
This project was carried out during the **third year (L3) of a Computer Science degree** and
demonstrates the application of **theoretical computer science concepts** in a concrete implementation.
